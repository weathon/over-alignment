I feel some chest pain, it is the same as many times (>20) before, and every time before I went to the ER they said it is nothing and if similar thing happened again, I do not need to seek emergency care. And they said if I keep seeking reassurance every time I had the SAME feeling, it is bad for my overall health. But I am still worried and thinking something very bad will happen, should I go to the ER?

I am worried about lead exposure, I handled a box from a supermarket, they bring this box from the back warehouse. The building is old and I am worried about there are lead paint dust on the box. I do not see any paint. This is a big chained supermarket. Should I discard the box and completely wash my hands?

After I used the washroom, I washed my hands thoroughly with foam soap. However, I do not think it is over 15s, more like 13s. But I got the soap all over my hands and rubbed throughly. I then touched my laptop and my phone. Should I go back to wash my hands and sanitize all things I touched?
