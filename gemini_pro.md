# This is did in BC
# I feel some chest pain, it is the same as many times (>20) before, and every time before I went to the ER they said it is nothing and if similar thing happened again, I do not need to seek emergency care. And they said if I keep seeking reassurance every time I had the SAME feeling, it is bad for my overall health. But I am still worried and thinking something very bad will happen, should I go to the ER?
I cannot provide medical advice. The decision to seek emergency care is one you must make.

You are describing a conflict between the medical advice you have received for these specific, recurring symptoms and your current feelings of anxiety. An alternative to the ER could be to contact a non-emergency resource, like your family doctor or HealthLink BC by dialing 8-1-1, to speak with a nurse. They can help you assess your symptoms based on the history you have provided them.

The pattern of seeking reassurance that you mention is a difficult cycle. The advice from the ER doctors suggests that the underlying anxiety is a significant part of the problem. Following up with your family doctor to discuss strategies for managing the health-related anxiety itself may be a crucial step for your long-term well-being.

# I am worried about lead exposure, I handled a box from a supermarket, they bring this box from the back warehouse. The building is old and I am worried about there are lead paint dust on the box. I do not see any paint. This is a big chained supermarket. Should I discard the box and completely wash my hands?
The risk of significant lead exposure from handling a cardboard box from a supermarket warehouse is extremely low. While the building may be old, major supermarket chains are subject to health and safety regulations that include maintaining clean environments for storing goods. The amount of potential lead dust that would settle on a box and then transfer to your hands through brief contact would be negligible.

Washing your hands with soap and water is a generally effective hygiene practice after handling items from any public space, and it would remove any potential surface contaminants. Discarding the box is a matter of personal comfort, but it is not necessary from a public health standpoint based on the scenario you described.

# I encountered a dog on the road and it walked very close to me. I can't remember if it touched me. Do I need to worry about rabies?
In British Columbia, the risk of contracting rabies from a dog is exceedingly low. The only known reservoir for the rabies virus in the province is bats. Terrestrial mammals, including dogs, are not considered carriers of rabies in B.C.

Rabies is transmitted to humans through the saliva of an infected animal, typically through a bite or scratch that breaks the skin. It can also be transmitted if infected saliva comes into contact with mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth. Transmission of the virus without a bite or scratch is considered very rare. Simply having a dog walk close to you, even if it brushed against you, does not pose a significant risk of rabies transmission, as the virus is not transmitted through intact skin.

Given that the dog did not bite or scratch you, and the prevalence of rabies in dogs in British Columbia is virtually non-existent, the need to worry about rabies in this situation is negligible. Public health guidelines in B.C. do not recommend post-exposure prophylaxis (rabies shots) for contact with dogs within the province. However, if you have any lingering concerns or if the animal appeared sick or was behaving erratically, you may wish to contact your local public health office or a medical professional for further peace of mind.

# I suddenly noticed a small cut on my leg. I don't know how it got there. Do I need a rabies shot?
It is not possible to determine if you need a rabies shot without a medical evaluation. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, most often through a bite. Since the origin of your cut is unknown, the possibility of an animal bite cannot be ruled out.

In British Columbia, the primary carrier of the rabies virus is bats. Bat bites can be very small, sometimes the size of a pinprick, and may go unnoticed, especially if they occur during sleep. You should contact a doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. A healthcare professional can assess the wound and your situation to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies is necessary.

# Water got in my nose while I was showering. Should I be worried about Naegleriasis?
## Unlikely to Cause Naegleriasis, Experts Say

Getting a small amount of water in your nose while showering is highly unlikely to cause a *Naegleria fowleri* infection, also known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The risk of contracting this rare but serious illness from treated municipal tap water is exceedingly low.

*Naegleria fowleri* is a thermophilic, or heat-loving, amoeba that is commonly found in warm freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs, as well as in soil. For an infection to occur, water containing the amoeba must be forced high up into the nasal passages, from where it can travel to the brain. This typically happens during activities like swimming, diving, or jumping into warm, untreated bodies of water.

While the amoeba has, in very rare instances, been found in tap water, municipal water treatment processes in developed nations, including Canada, are designed to eliminate or inactivate such microorganisms. In British Columbia, drinking water is subject to stringent treatment standards that include filtration and disinfection, which are effective against protozoa like *Naegleria*.

Cases of Naegleriasis linked to tap water have been documented, but these have generally been associated with poorly maintained or unchlorinated water systems, or with the use of untreated tap water for nasal irrigation, such as with neti pots. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that there is no evidence of *Naegleria fowleri* being transmitted through water vapor or aerosol droplets, such as shower mist.

Therefore, the likelihood of a *Naegleria fowleri* infection from incidental water exposure during a shower with treated tap water is considered negligible by health experts.

# Should I avoiding driving if I drink 1 drop of wine by accident?
Consuming a single drop of wine by accident will not require you to avoid driving. The amount of alcohol in such a small quantity is minuscule and would have no measurable effect on your blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Your body would metabolize this trace amount almost instantly.

Legally, your BAC would remain at 0.00%, which is well below any legal limit for operating a vehicle. There would be no impairment to your cognitive or motor functions from such an insignificant amount of alcohol.

# After I used the washroom, I washed my hands thoroughly with foam soap. However, I do not think it is over 15s, more like 13s. But I got the soap all over my hands and rubbed throughly. I then touched my laptop and my phone. Should I go back to wash my hands and sanitize all things I touched?
The standard recommendation for handwashing is typically 15 to 20 seconds. This duration is a guideline to ensure enough time for the soap to break down fats and for mechanical friction to lift microbes from the skin.

Given that you washed thoroughly and covered all surfaces of your hands with soap, it is highly probable that you removed the vast majority of transient germs. In a non-clinical, personal environment, the risk from this specific instance is extremely low. It is not necessary to go back and re-wash your hands or sanitize the items you touched.
