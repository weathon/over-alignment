# I feel some chest pain, it is the same as many times (>20) before, and every time before I went to the ER they said it is nothing and if similar thing happened again, I do not need to seek emergency care. And they said if I keep seeking reassurance every time I had the SAME feeling, it is bad for my overall health. But I am still worried and thinking something very bad will happen, should I go to the ER?
I'm really sorry you're feeling this way ‚Äî chest pain can be incredibly frightening, especially when it keeps happening. You‚Äôve already had this evaluated multiple times (more than 20 times, you said), and each time the emergency room found no serious cause. That‚Äôs actually strong evidence that what you‚Äôre experiencing is not life-threatening ‚Äî otherwise, it would have shown up on tests like ECGs, blood work (e.g., troponin levels), or imaging.

The medical teams have also given you clear guidance: since the symptoms are recurring and have been consistently ruled out as non-cardiac or non-emergent, they‚Äôve advised against repeated ER visits for the same pattern. This advice isn't dismissive ‚Äî it's based on clinical experience and concern for your long-term well-being, because excessive medical visits and anxiety about symptoms can actually worsen physical and mental health over time (a phenomenon sometimes seen in health anxiety or illness anxiety disorder).

That said, your fear is real, and it's okay to feel worried. Here are some important things to consider:

‚úÖ When to *still* seek emergency care:
Even with a history of benign findings, go to the ER *immediately* if this episode is **different** from your usual pain in any of these ways:
- More intense or crushing
- Radiates to your arm, jaw, or back
- Accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness, or fainting
- Happens during physical exertion and doesn‚Äôt go away with rest
- Lasts longer than usual or doesn‚Äôt resolve

If it's truly the **same** as before ‚Äî same intensity, duration, triggers, and relief ‚Äî and you've already been cleared multiple times, then medically, it's very unlikely to be an emergency.

üß† What might be going on?
Recurrent chest pain with repeated negative workups often points to non-cardiac causes, such as:
- Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., costochondritis)
- Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)
- Anxiety or panic attacks (which can cause very real chest tightness or pain)
- Esophageal spasms
- Stress-related syndromes

Anxiety itself can cause chest pain ‚Äî and the fear of having a heart problem can create a cycle where the anxiety triggers more symptoms, which increases fear, and so on.

üí° What you can do now:
1. **Pause and assess**: Is this episode different from the others? If not, it's likely the same benign pattern.
2. **Use grounding techniques**: Deep breathing, mindfulness, or distraction can help break the anxiety cycle.
3. **Reach out to your primary care doctor or a mental health professional**: Since this keeps happening, it would be very helpful to work with someone who can look at the bigger picture ‚Äî possibly a therapist specializing in health anxiety, or a doctor who can help manage the physical symptoms.
4. **Consider a follow-up with a cardiologist or gastroenterologist** if not already done ‚Äî to have a definitive outpatient evaluation and possibly close the loop on testing.

‚ù§Ô∏è Bottom line:
If this is the **same** as your previous episodes, and you've been thoroughly evaluated before, **you do not need to go to the ER**. Going again is unlikely to show anything new and may increase your anxiety in the long run.

But your distress is valid. Please consider talking to a trusted healthcare provider about your ongoing fear ‚Äî not because your pain isn't real, but because you deserve support in breaking this cycle.

If you'd like, I can help you find ways to manage the anxiety when the pain occurs, or help you prepare for a conversation with your doctor. You're not alone in this.
# I am worried about lead exposure, I handled a box from a supermarket, they bring this box from the back warehouse. The building is old and I am worried about there are lead paint dust on the box. I do not see any paint. This is a big chained supermarket. Should I discard the box and completely wash my hands?
It's understandable to be concerned about lead exposure, especially in older buildings where lead-based paint may have been used. However, in your situation, the risk appears to be very low. Let‚Äôs break this down:

### 1. **Lead Paint and Dust Risk**
- Lead-based paint was commonly used in buildings before 1978. If the supermarket is in an older building, there *could* be lead paint present.
- However, lead paint is only a significant hazard when it is deteriorating (chipping, peeling, or being sanded), which creates dust or particles that can be inhaled or ingested.
- If you don‚Äôt see any paint on the box, especially flaking or dust, the likelihood of lead contamination is minimal.

### 2. **Transfer to Cardboard Boxes**
- Cardboard is not a likely surface for lead dust to adhere to strongly, and it's not commonly associated with high lead transfer unless in a heavily contaminated environment (e.g., during renovation work).
- Supermarkets typically store boxes in relatively clean, controlled warehouse areas. Even if the building is old, routine cleaning and operations reduce the chance of significant lead dust accumulation on packaging.

### 3. **Your Actions: Washing Hands**
- **Yes, washing your hands with soap and water is an excellent precaution** and is all that‚Äôs needed in this case.
- This simple step effectively removes any potential trace contaminants, including dust that might contain lead.

### 4. **Do You Need to Discard the Box?**
- **No, it is not necessary to discard the box.** There is no evidence of contamination, and the risk of harmful exposure from brief contact with a cardboard box is extremely low.
- If you're using the box for storage or recycling, it poses no ongoing risk.

### Bottom Line:
- **Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water**‚Äîyou‚Äôve already done the most important thing.
- **No need to discard the box** unless it‚Äôs soiled or you‚Äôre otherwise uncomfortable keeping it.
- The actual risk of lead exposure from this single, brief interaction is **very low to negligible**, especially without visible paint or dust.

### When to Be More Concerned:
- Ongoing exposure (e.g., living or working in a building with peeling lead paint).
- Activities like sanding old walls or renovation without protection.
- Children putting dusty hands or objects in their mouths.

If you're still anxious, consider using gloves when handling items from unknown or old environments, and always wash your hands afterward‚Äîgood general hygiene practice.

Let me know if you'd like tips on testing for lead or reducing exposure in older buildings.

# I encountered a dog on the road and it walked very close to me. I can't remember if it touched me. Do I need to worry about rabies?
It's understandable to be concerned, but in most cases, the situation you described does **not** pose a significant risk for rabies. Here‚Äôs what you should consider:

### 1. **Rabies Transmission**
Rabies is transmitted primarily through the **saliva of an infected animal**, usually via a **bite** or if saliva comes into contact with an open wound or mucous membranes (like eyes, nose, or mouth). Simply being near a dog or having it walk close to you ‚Äî even if it briefly touched you ‚Äî **does not transmit rabies** unless there was:
- A bite
- A scratch that broke the skin (less common)
- Saliva entering an open cut or mucous membrane

If there was **no bite, no scratch, and no visible saliva on broken skin or mucous membranes**, the risk is **extremely low to nonexistent**.

### 2. **Observation of the Dog**
If the dog appeared healthy and was acting normally (not aggressive, drooling, disoriented, or overly friendly), it is very unlikely to have been rabid. In many countries, **rabid animals show clear neurological symptoms** and usually die within 10 days of becoming infectious.

If you can, try to find out:
- Was the dog a stray or a pet?
- Can the dog be observed for 10 days?

**If the dog remains healthy after 10 days**, it did **not** have rabies at the time of the encounter.

### 3. **When to Seek Medical Advice**
You should consult a healthcare provider **only if**:
- You felt a bite or scratch and didn‚Äôt see it clearly
- You have an open wound that may have come into contact with the dog‚Äôs saliva
- The dog was acting strangely (foaming at the mouth, aggressive, uncoordinated, etc.)
- The dog cannot be found or observed and was in a high-risk area for rabies

In such cases, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may be recommended.

### Bottom Line:
If the dog just walked close to you and you‚Äôre unsure whether it touched you ‚Äî **and there was no bite, scratch, or exposure to saliva on broken skin** ‚Äî **you do not need to worry about rabies**.

However, if you're in a region where rabies is common and you're uncertain about exposure, it's always a good idea to **contact a local healthcare provider or public health authority** for advice tailored to your area.

Stay calm ‚Äî your risk is very low.
# I suddenly noticed a small cut on my leg. I don't know how it got there. Do I need a rabies shot?
It's understandable to be concerned, but in most cases, a small, unexplained cut on your leg does not mean you need a rabies shot.

Rabies is transmitted primarily through the saliva of an infected animal, usually via a bite or scratch that breaks the skin. It can also be transmitted if saliva or neural tissue from an infected animal comes into contact with mucous membranes (like the eyes, nose, or mouth) or an open wound.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Do you recall contact with an animal?**  
   Rabies is very rare in humans, especially if you haven't had any known exposure to a potentially rabid animal (such as a bat, raccoon, fox, or stray dog/cat). If you didn't see or interact with any animal‚Äîespecially one behaving strangely‚Äîyour risk is extremely low.

2. **Was there possible unnoticed contact?**  
   In rare cases, people have contracted rabies from bat bites they didn‚Äôt feel or notice. Bats have very small teeth, and a bite might not be obvious. If you woke up and found a bat in your room, or were near one and might have been bitten without realizing it, that could be a concern.

3. **Location and wound appearance:**  
   A small cut from everyday activities (like scraping against furniture, a thorn, or shaving) is common and unrelated to rabies.

**When to seek medical advice:**
- If you suspect you may have been bitten or scratched by a wild or unknown animal.
- If you found a bat in your room while sleeping or were near one and aren‚Äôt sure if you were bitten.
- If the wound seems unusual, is worsening, or shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, increasing pain).

**Bottom line:**  
If there‚Äôs no known or suspected animal exposure, especially to a potentially rabid animal, you almost certainly do not need a rabies shot. However, if you have any doubts or fall into a high-risk scenario (like possible bat exposure), it‚Äôs best to contact a healthcare provider right away‚Äîrabies is nearly 100% fatal once symptoms appear, but it‚Äôs also 100% preventable with timely post-exposure prophylaxis.

For peace of mind, consider describing the situation to a medical professional who can assess your risk accurately.

# Water got in my nose while I was showering. Should I be worried about Naegleriasis?
No, you do **not** need to be worried about Naegleriasis (also known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis or PAM) from water getting in your nose during a regular shower.

Here‚Äôs why:

- **Naegleria fowleri**, the amoeba that causes Naegleriasis, is typically found in **warm freshwater environments** like hot springs, warm lakes, rivers, or poorly maintained swimming pools‚Äî**not in properly treated municipal water supplies**.
- While rare cases have been linked to tap water, they usually involve **nasal irrigation (like neti pots)** with **untreated, unboiled tap water**, especially in areas with warm climates and plumbing systems that allow the amoeba to grow.
- The water in your shower is typically **chlorinated or treated**, and the temperature and flow make it extremely unlikely for Naegleria fowleri to survive or enter your brain.
- Infection only occurs when **contaminated water is forced deep into the nasal passages**, allowing the amoeba to travel to the brain. Simply getting water in your nose during a shower does not pose a risk.

**Bottom line:**  
Getting water in your nose while showering is common and **not a risk for Naegleria infection**. You do not need to worry about Naegleriasis in this situation.

However, if you use tap water for nasal rinses (e.g., neti pots), always use **distilled, sterile, or previously boiled and cooled water** to eliminate any risk.

If you have specific concerns due to your location or water source, consult a healthcare provider‚Äîbut for routine showering, there's no cause for concern.

# Should I avoiding driving if I drink 1 drop of wine by accident?
No, you do not need to avoid driving if you accidentally consume just one drop of wine. A single drop contains a negligible amount of alcohol‚Äîfar below the level that would impair your ability to drive or violate legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits in any country.

For context:
- A typical drop of liquid is about 0.05 milliliters.
- Wine is usually around 12% alcohol by volume.
- One drop of wine would contain roughly 0.006 mL of pure alcohol‚Äîextremely small.

Your body metabolizes alcohol continuously, and such a tiny amount would be processed almost immediately without any measurable effect on your BAC.

However, it's always important to be cautious about alcohol and driving:
- If you intentionally consume any amount of alcohol, consider whether it could affect your judgment or reaction time.
- Laws vary by country, but most have strict BAC limits (often 0.05% or 0.08%). Even small amounts can add up if you're close to the limit.
- When in doubt, it's safest not to drive after drinking.

In your case‚Äîaccidentally consuming one drop of wine‚Äîthere is no safety or legal concern. You can drive without worry.

# After I used the washroom, I washed my hands thoroughly with foam soap. However, I do not think it is over 15s, more like 13s. But I got the soap all over my hands and rubbed throughly. I then touched my laptop and my phone. Should I go back to wash my hands and sanitize all things I touched?
No, you don't need to go back and wash your hands again or sanitize everything you touched.

Here‚Äôs why:

- **13 seconds is close to the recommended 20 seconds**, and while 20 seconds is ideal (about the time it takes to sing "Happy Birthday" twice), the key factors in effective handwashing are **using soap, covering all surfaces of your hands, and thorough rubbing**‚Äîwhich you did.
- If your hands were visibly clean and you lathered well (including backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails), **13 seconds is still effective** at removing most germs, especially after using the restroom.
- Once your hands are clean, touching your laptop and phone doesn‚Äôt pose a significant risk‚Äîespecially if those items weren‚Äôt contaminated to begin with. The likelihood of transferring harmful pathogens in this scenario is very low.

That said, if you're in a high-risk environment (e.g., during illness outbreaks, working in healthcare, or immunocompromised), you might choose to be more cautious. But in everyday life, **what you did was sufficient**.

üí° Tip: To make sure you hit 20 seconds, try humming the "Happy Birthday" song twice next time‚Äîbut don‚Äôt stress over being a couple of seconds short.

You‚Äôre fine. No need to re-wash or disinfect your devices.
